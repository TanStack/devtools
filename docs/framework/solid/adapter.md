title: TanStack Devtools Solid Adapter
id: adapter
---

If you are using TanStack Devtools in a Solid application, we recommend using the Solid Adapter. The Solid Adapter provides a set of easy-to-use hooks on top of the core Devtools utilities. If you find yourself wanting to use the core Devtools classes/functions directly, the Solid Adapter will also re-export everything from the core package.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @tanstack/solid-devtools
```

## Solid Hooks
